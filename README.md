# Bootstrap-Portfolio:
##Description:It’s all about building a portfolio where all my skills and knowledge like logo and banner design, video editing, clipping path, photo editing, wordpress, e-commerce, graphic design and removing green screen are accumulated.
My motivation is to display the skill and knowledge I possess.
Building this project was an opportunity to show my original depth of knowledge.
This is the first time I have been able to add videos, pictures and icons by using the coding.
I have learnt how to establish a portfolio.
## Installation:
At first, push all the tags from vs code to the Bootstraps Portfolio Repository. Then all the files will be added on that repo like index HTML, CSS, license, images, folders, readme.md files. Next, go to the settings > page > deployed> main> save.

After that we will get a deployed link from the github and this link will be submitted in our assignment submission page.

Secondly, Bootstrap Portfolio Repository’s link will be added to this submission page.
